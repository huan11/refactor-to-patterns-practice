Key IDEA: 
1. intention-revealing step


Key Skill:
1. Extract Method
* The most difficult part is deciding what code to include or
   not include in an extracted method.
* A Composed Method’s name communicates what it does(communicate their purposes ), 
  while its body communicates how it does what it does. 

2. Use the same level of detail （is current code at the same level of detail with others？）
* When you break up one method into chunks of behavior, 
make the chunks operate at similar levels of detail
* intention-revealing steps （高层业务概念，面向业务编程）
